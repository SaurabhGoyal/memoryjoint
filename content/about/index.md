# Work
I am a backend developer, graduated in 2015 from JSSATE, Noida with B.Tech in Computer Science.
- My interest in computers started with games. My interest in programming started during graduation with Data-Structures.
- I have ~9 years of web development experience in domains like HealthTech (B.Well and HealthifyMe), Payments (Amazon and Flip.id) and Mobility (Uber).
- I recently (April, 2024) took a career break to upskill myself. The break is to find the direction. I have been inclining towards learning `Rust` and building applications hich are closer to the processor and require good engineering to maximise processor's usage via the APIs provided by Operating-System and Kernel.
- Checkout my projects to know more about what I have built.

# Personal
I like thinking about stuff like ethics and psychology. I like TV (shows and movies) that make me feel human emotions I can never encounter in my life.
