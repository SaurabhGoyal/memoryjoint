Why finance
- Economy is the 2nd most important thing after sex.
- Finance (Wallstreet) is essentially information processing and creates the conditions that create the market (Mainstreet).
- While there is a feedback loop from mainstreet to wallstreet which forms the incentives for wallstreet, finance acts as a selector of the mainstreet player to encourage from available options.
- The selection criteria is based on real world impact but the impact itself is speculative and hence finance acts more on its own discretion.

History
- 1000 years ago -
    - P2P money lending with `unlimited liability`, i.e. borrower HAD TO pay, else they go to debtors' prison.
- ~14th century -
    - Europe's agriculture limit was exhausted to the point that cold storage of summer's produce (specially meat) was needed to survivde through the winter. The only way to preserve meet was spices (specially pepper). So Europe needed pepper as life-death matter and that was available in the East (specially India).
    - In 1453, The OLttomon empire captured Istanbul and cut the land route from Europe to India which forced Europeans to explore the sea route which is when ships started becoming a norm. Europeans took that path despite a fatality rate of 25% per voyage because of the even higher fatality rate of the winter.
    - A single spice trade required building a ship, hiring the crew, stocking some metal ware to trade the spice with, crew and ship taking the journey all the way to India and then bringing the pepper and cardamom back. The investment needed for this was huge and chance of success for this was 75%. That is when need of joint investment arose and an initial joint venture kind of situation was formed. Hundreds of people will pool in money for single trade so that both the risk and rewards are distributed among them thus not causing huge impact to any single person.  
    - This also introduced the concept of `limited liability`, i.e. if the returns of the venture are zero, no person is liable to pay the money from any fund other than what they have already put. This makes sense, this is basically that the money on the table is only the money that was collected and no more. Point to note here is that no person who is part of the venture has any liability to produce pay-off / returns other than the goals of the venture, even if that person is the sole manager of the venture (such as CEO). That is where it becomes very important to choose the right persons for the venture.
    - Essentially it is a separation of the person(promoter / executer) from the venture (idea) and the lender lends to the venture and not to the person thus making the liability of the person to pay-off thje debt zero. We can see the main cultural difference is moving from a risk-averse society earlier to a risk-tolerant society now by promoting less risk for the peromoter / executer.
    - I think this is nothing but `interest based lending` vs `equity based lending`.
    - The partial investment instruments enabled people to invest in more than one ships and reducing their risks further by diversification. This naturally evolved into a market for trading these investments. The market further enabled another thing - `on-demand liquidity` of the investment. Compared to any other real asset, you can get your money back by selling your investment instrument in the market irrespective of the status of the venture, i.e. whether ship has returned or not yet. This gave a huge push to investments. The investment instrument is essentially a conviction in an idea and provides complex actions that can be done to that conviction -
        - If one find the conviction underrated, one can buy and hold.
        - If one finds the execution of the idea not towards good returns future, one can sell the conviction.
        - If one finds the conviction overrated, one can borrow and do short-selling. This is not possible without the concept of investment instrument.
    - //personal note - While there are benefits to attaching investment instrument to a venture's execution, one must not loose sight of the fact that market and its actions can cause NO IMPACT on the venture and its execution, they can only cause impact on the conviction people have on the idea and its execution, which is just a perception and DOES NOT directly link with the future return potential of the venture. Another problem of separating conviction from physical reality is that it can wander far off from the truth, it can take its own form and can even overshadow the reality of execution of the venture.
    - //personal note - Ajay is constantly suggesting that people look at stock market prices and it encourages them to start or not start businesses in various areas and this is how wallstreet controls mainstreet and that this is beautiful because the market price is a reflection of how every individual sees the venture as and noone can manipulate that collective voice. I see two problems there - (1) A collective voice is not always the right voice, it may be too risk-averse, herd mentality or influenced by the wrong factors. All of that may give wrong encouragements and discouragements to people (2) Markets themselves are centrally controlled by controllers, regulators and policy makers which gives taints the market because people would always try to influence that position of power to manipulate the market. Amit also calls out on that but Ajay says that's part of the deal and generally very limited.
- ~14th-19th centruy -
    - He calls out that novel ways of information sharing such as pigeons was used to get information about significant events faster and gain an edge over the market. 
    - Stock trading and investment instruments have become a very common and age old practice and market is a huge, living entity that has huge influence over the world's activities.
- ~19th-20th centruy -
    - Banks are getting well established institutions. Ajay calls out that banking is a broken system and that he is pessimistic about that being solved ever but does not give any detail.
    - //personal note - read more about it.
- ~Late 20th century and modern time -
    - He says modern finance saw huge impeact because of technology, specifically because the scale of creation, communication and processing of information exploded exponentially. Ajay suggests that increased speed and quantity of information has brought more fairness in the system and encouraged more people to be in the finance industry which have produced great amount of knowledge about economies. He describes story of Amazon hiring economists to study and find ways to sell products more, as a success story of modern finance. 
    //personal note - The story seems to be a warning for how economists are contributing to manipulative nature of capitalism. The crux is that economics' main success metric is the demand and activity on its own instruments and not neccessarily the standard of living. I accept that the later comes as a side effect of the former but may not always be aligned well with the former. Another point is to define standard of living or growth of quality of life well. Realistically the factors that make up the standard of living keep changing with time and that makes it hard to compare a certain life in time t1 to a life in another time t2. For ex.- Compared to a middle class man in 1960s, today's middle class  has access to a million times faster communication technology, 100 times faster transportation, 100 times better medical facilities. However, education, housing, recreational attitude and financial freedom are taking a hit. Research more about these factors, both at individual and society level.
    - Derivatives - Betting on performance of the primary investment instruments.

What can go wrong 
- Ajay suggests that a luddite mindset about finance is harmful to country, no details provided.

What went wrong in middle east
- Amit quotes an author Timur Kuran and his analysis on why middle east which was same as Europe economically in 1000 AD but didn't make any economical growth till middle 20th century while Europe grew exponentially. The main reason he says is the inheritance law of Islam. The law is that 1/3rd of the wealth of a person goes to the sons and daughters and 2/3rd to the extended family of the diseased. While the law is progressive, it meant that if a venture partnership is formed and a partner dies, his shares are distribuited among a large number of people making it very difficult to keep the venture running. This discouraged any large joint venture partnerships.

Amit's Recommendation -
- Timur Kuran - private truths public lies
