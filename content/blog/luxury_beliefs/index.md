Luxury beliefs
- Socialism -
    - Citizen has no freedom, it is a subject, freedom is not the default, it is given to you by state.\
    - Bad, India was socialist for ~3 decades and then Gandhi family slowly moved away from that and moved to liberal economic policies. Manmohan singh also played a role.
    - The constitution preamble still holds the word "socialist".
    - read communist manifesto.
- Inequality - 
    - Inequality will always be there in a free world because people will have different interests and actions.
    - The area to focus is poverty, you define the basic threshold of standard of living which is sufficient and healthy for a person to live and then you try to bring everyone above that.
    - Point to note is that in any growing society, inequality will increase but that should not be tied to the poverty issue, poverty is not dependent on that and should be tackled on its own.
- Victimless crimes -
    - Prostitution and betting are victimless, and people take part in them anyway in illegal ways which makes them facing issues (such as violance against sex workers, defaulters in a betting transaction) much more likely because then they can't go to the state to complain about those issues. He says that generally prohibitions of victimless activities result in underworld taking over that activity and turning it into a scam filled mess. He gives an example of Matunga case where due to Article 377, homosecuality was a crime earlier and policemen used to put ads to bait such people and the extort money from them.
- Anti capatalism, child labour -
- Price controls -
    - Price is generally a result of all the scarcities and constraints on a commodity. Controlling that would make the market disappear.

Why do [rich] people have these?
- [Obvious one] To feel virtuous cheaply.
- To feel safer among the less-privileged by falsely signalling to them a concern for them. This is similar to why statemen build things like temples.
