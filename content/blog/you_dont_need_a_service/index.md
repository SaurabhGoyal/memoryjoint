# What is the problem today?
- I have a [github account](https://github.com/SaurabhGoyal/) where I push my code frequently. As a software engineer, this acts as a portfolio page of my work. During my career break in summer, 2024, I worked on a torrent client project and some rust_labs tiny projects. Just when I started applying to companies and shared my profile, my github account was suspended without any reason. I reached out and got no response. After 2 days of no response, I immediately made an account in Gitlab and pushed my code (the one that I had in my machine) there and started sharing that on my resume. Problem solved! No! What I lost was the people I was following on github, the ability to fork and contribute to projects hosted on Github and the repositories that I didn't have in my machine and were hosted only in Github. Side note - They responded after 2 months with a single message that they saw some suspicious activity and gave no further details.
- I have a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/notintobuying) where I post and I randomly see scammish reposts from my profile which I didn't do. Whatever followers I have there do not automatically know me on Github or email, stackoverfow, goodreads or someplace else. My social network on each platform needs to be manually cross connected and built every time. Twitter also keeps suspending the account on a whim once a while. Every time I am posting something, I know that Twitter can read it and can censor it or in the worst case can use against me.

# What all services do I use?
- Google -
    - email - Email server (personal only i.e. no discovery)
    - drive - File server (personal only i.e. no discovery, sharing by direct links)
    - photos - Photos server, essentially a sub-application of drive (personal only i.e. no discovery, sharing by direct links)
    - notes - Text file server, essentially a sub-application of drive (personal only i.e. no discovery, sharing by direct links)
    - youtube - Video server (mainly social i.e. discovery as main sharing mechanism)
    - search - Indexing server (mainly global i.e. discovery by large scale scraping)
- OTT -
    - netflix -  media content library, essentially a disc store (not social at all)
    - prime video -  media content library, essentially a disc store (not social at all)
